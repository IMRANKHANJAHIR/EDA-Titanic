# 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship** program. The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the **Titanic dataset** to identify patterns, trends, and insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.

---

## 📊 Objective

Understand the Titanic dataset using:
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualizations
- Pattern and anomaly detection

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📁 Dataset

Titanic dataset from Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 🚀 What’s Included

- `EDA_Titanic.py`: Main Python script for performing EDA.
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Correlation matrix
  - Pairplot
  - Survival vs Age/Passenger Class plots

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Higher survival rates were observed among:
  - Women
  - Younger passengers
  - Passengers in 1st class
- Missing values found in `Age` and `Cabin` columns.
- Strong correlation between `Fare`, `Pclass`, and `Survived`.
